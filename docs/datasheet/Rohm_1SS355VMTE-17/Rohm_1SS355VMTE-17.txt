Notice 
 
Precaution on using ROHM Products 
1. 
Our Products are designed and manufactured for application in ordinary electronic equipments (such as AV equipment, 
OA equipment, telecommunication equipment, home electronic appliances, amusement equipment, etc.).  If you 
intend to use our Products in devices requiring extremely high reliability (such as medical equipment (Note 1), transport 
equipment, traffic equipment, aircraft/spacecraft, nuclear power controllers, fuel controllers, car equipment including car 
accessories, safety devices, etc.) and whose malfunction or failure may cause loss of human life, bodily injury or 
serious damage to property (“Specific Applications”), please consult with the ROHM sales representative in advance. 
Unless otherwise agreed in writing by ROHM in advance, ROHM shall not be in any way responsible or liable for any 
damages, expenses or losses incurred by you or third parties arising from the use of any ROHM’s Products for Specific 
Applications. 
(Note1) Medical Equipment Classification of the Specific Applications 
JAPAN 
USA 
EU 
CHINA 
CLASSⅢ 
CLASSⅢ 
CLASSⅡb 
CLASSⅢ 
CLASSⅣ 
CLASSⅢ 
 
2.  ROHM designs and manufactures its Products subject to strict quality control system. However, semiconductor 
products can fail or malfunction at a certain rate. Please be sure to implement, at your own responsibilities, adequate 
safety measures including but not limited to fail-safe design against the physical injury, damage to any property, which 
a failure or malfunction of our Products may cause. The following are examples of safety measures: 
[a] Installation of protection circuits or other protective devices to improve system safety 
[b] Installation of redundant circuits to reduce the impact of single or multiple circuit failure 
 
3. 
Our Products are designed and manufactured for use under standard conditions and not under any special or 
extraordinary environments or conditions, as exemplified below. Accordingly, ROHM shall not be in any way 
responsible or liable for any damages, expenses or losses arising from the use of any ROHM’s Products under any 
special or extraordinary environments or conditions.  If you intend to use our Products under any special or 
extraordinary environments or conditions (as exemplified below), your independent verification and confirmation of 
product performance, reliability, etc, prior to use, must be necessary: 
[a] Use of our Products in any types of liquid, including water, oils, chemicals, and organic solvents 
[b] Use of our Products outdoors or in places where the Products are exposed to direct sunlight or dust 
[c] Use of our Products in places where the Products are exposed to sea wind or corrosive gases, including Cl2, 
H2S, NH3, SO2, and NO2 
[d] Use of our Products in places where the Products are exposed to static electricity or electromagnetic waves 
[e] Use of our Products in proximity to heat-producing components, plastic cords, or other flammable items 
[f] Sealing or coating our Products with resin or other coating materials 
[g] Use of our Products without cleaning residue of flux (even if you use no-clean type fluxes, cleaning residue of 
flux is recommended); or Washing our Products by using water or water-soluble cleaning agents for cleaning 
residue after soldering 
[h] Use of the Products in places subject to dew condensation 
 
4. 
The Products are not subject to radiation-proof design. 
 
5. 
Please verify and confirm characteristics of the final or mounted products in using the Products. 
 
6.  In particular, if a transient load (a large amount of load applied in a short period of time, such as pulse. is applied, 
confirmation of performance characteristics after on-board mounting is strongly recommended. Avoid applying power 
exceeding normal rated power; exceeding the power rating under steady-state loading condition may negatively affect 
product performance and reliability. 
 
7.  De-rate Power Dissipation depending on ambient temperature. When used in sealed area, confirm that it is the use in 
the range that does not exceed the maximum junction temperature. 
 
8.  Confirm that operation temperature is within the specified range described in the product specification. 
 
9.  ROHM shall not be in any way responsible or liable for failure induced under deviant condition from what is defined in 
this document. 
 
Precaution for Mounting / Circuit board design 
1. 
When a highly active halogenous (chlorine, bromine, etc.) flux is used, the residue of flux may negatively affect product 
performance and reliability. 
2.  In principle, the reflow soldering method must be used on a surface-mount products, the flow soldering method must 
be used on a through hole mount products. If the flow soldering method is preferred on a surface-mount products, 
please consult with the ROHM representative in advance. 
For details, please refer to ROHM Mounting specification

Precautions Regarding Application Examples and External Circuits 
1. 
If change is made to the constant of an external circuit, please allow a sufficient margin considering variations of the 
characteristics of the Products and external components, including transient characteristics, as well as static 
characteristics. 
 
2. 
You agree that application notes, reference designs, and associated data and information contained in this document 
are presented only as guidance for Products use.  Therefore, in case you use such information, you are solely 
responsible for it and you must exercise your own independent verification and judgment in the use of such information 
contained in this document.  ROHM shall not be in any way responsible or liable for any damages, expenses or losses 
incurred by you or third parties arising from the use of such information. 
 
Precaution for Electrostatic 
This Product is electrostatic sensitive product, which may be damaged due to electrostatic discharge. Please take proper 
caution in your manufacturing process and storage so that voltage exceeding the Products maximum rating will not be 
applied to Products. Please take special care under dry condition (e.g. Grounding of human body / equipment / solder iron, 
isolation from charged objects, setting of Ionizer, friction prevention and temperature / humidity control). 
 
Precaution for Storage / Transportation 
1. 
Product performance and soldered connections may deteriorate if the Products are stored in the places where: 
[a] the Products are exposed to sea winds or corrosive gases, including Cl2, H2S, NH3, SO2, and NO2 
[b] the temperature or humidity exceeds those recommended by ROHM 
[c] the Products are exposed to direct sunshine or condensation 
[d] the Products are exposed to high Electrostatic 
 
2. 
Even under ROHM recommended storage condition, solderability of products out of recommended storage time period 
may be degraded. It is strongly recommended to confirm solderability before using Products of which storage time is 
exceeding the recommended storage time period. 
 
3.  Store / transport cartons in the correct direction, which is indicated on a carton with a symbol. Otherwise bent leads 
may occur due to excessive stress applied when dropping of a carton. 
 
4.  Use Products within the specified time after opening a humidity barrier bag. Baking is required before using Products of 
which storage time is exceeding the recommended storage time period. 
 
Precaution for Product Label 
A two-dimensional barcode printed on ROHM Products label is for ROHM’s internal use only. 
 
Precaution for Disposition 
When disposing Products please dispose them properly using an authorized industry waste company. 
 
Precaution for Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade act 
Since concerned goods might be fallen under listed items of export control prescribed by Foreign exchange and Foreign 
trade act, please consult with ROHM in case of export.
