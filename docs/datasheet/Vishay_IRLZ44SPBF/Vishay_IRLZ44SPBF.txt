DESCRIPTION
Third generation Power MOSFETs from Vishay provide the 
designer with the best combination of fast switching, 
ruggedized 
device 
design, 
low 
on-resistance 
and 
cost-effectiveness.
The D2PAK (TO-263) is a surface-mount power package 
capable of accommodating die sizes up to HEX-4. It 
provides the highest power capability and the lowest 
possible on-resistance in any existing surface-mount 
package. The D2PAK (TO-263) is suitable for high current 
applications because of its low internal connection 
resistance and can dissipate up to 2.0 W in a typical surface 
mount application.
Note
a. See device orientation
Notes
b. Repetitive rating; pulse width limited by maximum junction temperature (see fig. 11)
c. VDD = 25 V, starting TJ = 25 °C, L = 179 μH, Rg = 25 , IAS = 51 A (see fig. 12)
d. ISD  51 A, dI/dt  250 A/μs, VDD  VDS, TJ  175 °C
e. 1.6 mm from case
f.
When mounted on 1" square PCB (FR-4 or G-10 material)
