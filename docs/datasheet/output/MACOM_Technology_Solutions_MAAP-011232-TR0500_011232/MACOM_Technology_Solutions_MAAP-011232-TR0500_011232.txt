Description 
The MAAP-011232 is a 2-stage power amplifier with 
gain shut off, operating from 100 MHz to 3 GHz. For 
operation in the 100 MHz to 1 GHz frequency range 
no I/O matching is required. Internal DC blocking is 
provided at the input, while the RF output port is DC 
coupled through an external bias-tee. Bias current, 
RF gain and output power are controlled with a gate 
bias voltage (VG). Typical current consumption is      
<300 mA at maximum output power. 
 
The MAAP-011232 is well suited to both power and 
driver requirements for multiple applications. 
 
The MAAP-011232 is fabricated using a GaAs        
D-mode high breakdown process which features full 
passivation for increased performance and reliability. 
* Restrictions on Hazardous Substances, compliant to current RoHS EU directive.

Absolute Maximum Ratings5,6 
5. Exceeding any one or combination of these limits may cause     
permanent damage to this device. 
6. MACOM does not recommend sustained operation near these 
survivability limits. 
7. Operating at nominal conditions with TJ ≤ +150°C will ensure 
MTTF > 1 x 106 hours. 
8. Junction Temperature (TJ) = TC + ӨJC * [(V * I) - (POUT - PIN)] 
    Typical thermal resistance (Өjc) = 29°C/W.

Operating the MAAP-011232 
To operate the device, follow these steps: 
 
1. Set VG to -2 V. 
2. Turn on VD1 and VD2 to 5-9 V. 
3. Adjust VG to set IDQ2 (IDQ1 varies). 
4. Turn off in reverse order with VG last. 
Handling Procedures 
Please observe the following precautions to avoid 
damage: 
 
Static Sensitivity 
These 
electronic 
devices 
are 
sensitive 
to 
electrostatic discharge (ESD) and can be damaged 
by static electricity.  Proper ESD control techniques 
should be used when handling these (HBM) Class 
1A devices.
